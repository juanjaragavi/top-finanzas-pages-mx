fix(mobile): optimize banner image positioning and text readability

- Adjust background position to "center 30%" for better subject focus on mobile
- Add stronger overlay (50% opacity) on mobile for improved text contrast
- Implement responsive text sizing with smaller base size on mobile devices
- Add text drop-shadows to enhance readability over background image
- Reduce vertical padding on mobile for better screen space utilization
- Set explicit background-size and prevent background tiling
- Adjust component spacing with responsive margins for mobile layouts

This commit improves the banner's appearance and readability on mobile devices
while maintaining the desktop experience. The changes ensure better text
contrast against the background image and more appropriate use of screen space
on smaller devices.
