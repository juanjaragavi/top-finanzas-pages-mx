fix: improve mobile UI for navigation and banner

Header Navigation Improvements:
- Fix mega menu overflow issue with responsive width constraints
- Implement proper menu toggle behavior with fixed ref handling
- Fix TypeScript errors with proper callback implementations
- Add responsive styling for menu columns and better mobile display

Banner Mobile Optimization:
- Align background image to the left on mobile devices
- Use React hooks for responsive background position detection
- Add stronger text overlay (50% opacity) on mobile for better readability
- Add text drop-shadows to enhance contrast against the image
- Implement responsive text sizing and padding adjustments

These changes significantly improve the mobile user experience by
ensuring menus stay within viewport boundaries, proper image positioning
for smaller screens, and enhanced text readability across all devices.
