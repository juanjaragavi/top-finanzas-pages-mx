fix: Resolve Vercel deployment CSS and routing issues

This commit fixes critical issues that prevented the website from rendering correctly when deployed to Vercel:

- Fixed assetPrefix configuration in next.config.mjs to allow proper loading of CSS and JS files
- Updated middleware.ts to handle path routing properly in the Vercel environment
- Added support for URL paths with and without the /mx prefix for better compatibility
- Improved error handling for blog-style URL routes
