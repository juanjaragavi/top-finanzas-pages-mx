chore: Clean up deployment files and simplify configuration

This commit includes several cleanup actions:

- Removed all backup configuration files including next.config.mjs.bak
- Removed unused Git commit message templates
- Removed legacy script merge_dev_to_stable.sh
- Removed ts-pages-sa.json configuration file
- Simplified deployment process with streamlined middleware
- Enhanced Vercel deployment stability with cleaner configuration

These changes improve maintainability by removing redundant files and
simplifying the deployment process across all environments.
