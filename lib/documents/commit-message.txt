fix: Simplify deployment configuration for Vercel

This commit removes the complex middleware rewriting and WordPress integration:

- Removed middleware path mappings and rewriting logic
- Simplified middleware.ts to just pass through all requests
- Removed basePath and assetPrefix configurations from next.config.mjs
- Eliminated all /mx/ subdirectory references to simplify deployment
- Created a direct routing approach that works consistently on Vercel
- Fixed 404 errors by eliminating path translation complexity
