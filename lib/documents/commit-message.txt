fix: Add missing blog page routes and fix middleware path mapping

This commit resolves 404 errors for blog-style pages:

- Updated middleware.ts to properly handle all blog-style URLs with and without /mx prefix
- Added direct path mappings for all blog post routes including guia-tarjeta-de-credito-nu-bank-next
- Created separate metadata.ts file for the Nu Bank guide page to follow Next.js best practices
- Removed generateMetadata function from page component to use the separate metadata file
- Improved path detection logic for clean URLs in both local and Vercel environments
