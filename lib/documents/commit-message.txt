feat: Enable Turbopack and remove deprecated @next/font

This commit introduces two key changes:

1.  **Enabled Turbopack:** Added the `--turbo` flag to the `dev` script in `package.json` to leverage Turbopack for faster development builds.
2.  **Removed @next/font:** Uninstalled the deprecated `@next/font` package as it's no longer needed with the built-in `next/font` module available in Next.js 14+.

These changes improve the development experience and ensure the project uses the latest recommended Next.js features.
