Move documentation files from root to lib/documents directory

- Relocated non-essential Markdown and text files from project root to lib/documents/
- Moved the following files while preserving content:
  - blog-functionality-report.md
  - commit-message-banner.txt
  - commit-message.txt
  - DEPLOYMENT.md
  - final-commit-message.txt
  - IMPLEMENTATION.md
  - n8n-workflow-analysis.md
  - refactoring-plan.md
- Maintained README.md in the project root
- Reduced root directory clutter for easier project navigation
- Improved project organization by centralizing documentation files

This change organizes the project structure by keeping only essential files in
the root directory, while moving all documentation to the appropriate lib/documents/ 
subdirectory.
