feat(deployment): Add automation scripts for Next.js deployment

Add a comprehensive set of bash scripts to automate the deployment process:
- Create scripts for rebuilding the Next.js application
- Add PM2 service management scripts
- Implement a unified deployment workflow
- Organize scripts in a dedicated 'scripts' directory
- Add a convenience wrapper script in project root

These scripts follow bash best practices with proper error handling,
logging, and documentation to ensure reliable and maintainable deployments.
