fix: optimize font loading and build pipeline

- Replace deprecated @next/font with built-in next/font
- Remove @next/font dependency from package.json
- Remove explicit @next/font installation from deployment scripts
- Optimize font configuration to use fewer weights (400, 500, 600)
- Enable optimizeFonts and optimizeCss in Next.js config
- Add critters package for CSS optimization
- Fix duplicate import statement in layout.tsx

This commit resolves the font loading errors during builds, improves build 
performance, and ensures compatibility with future Next.js versions.
